# Ising spin models
just some fooling around with machine learning and some ising spin models.
Note that all the models and most calculations are motivated by the paper of Carasquilla and Melko, Nature Physics 13, 431 (2017)

The following models are treated
* 2D Ising model
* Ising Square Ice Model
* Ising Lattice Gauge Theory

Finally, I have also added some files regarding the Aubry-Andre model (I know it is not a spin model, but it is also treated in the above mentioned publication)

Disclaimers:
* This is work in progress, so don't count on anything just yet.
* The Monte Carlo sampling that I have implemented is very much ad-hoc. Should most certainly not be used for legitimate scientific computations.
